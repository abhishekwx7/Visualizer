            <p>
                In Linear Search Algorithm ,
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every element is considered as a potential match for the key and checked for the same.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If any element is found equal to the key, the search is successful and the index of that element is
                    returned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If no element is found equal to the key, the search yields “No match found”.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    Best Case: In the best case, the key might be present at the first index. So the best case
                    complexity is O(1)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worst Case: In the worst case, the key might be present at the last index i.e., opposite to the end
                    from which the search has started in the list. So the worst-case complexity is O(N) where N is the
                    size of the list.
                </li>
                <li>

            <p>
                In Binary Search Algorithm ,
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index “mid”. .
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.
