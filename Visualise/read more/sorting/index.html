            <p>
                In this algorithm ,
            <ul>
                <li>traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. </li>
                <li>In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. </li>
                <li>This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is
                    sorted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Insertion Sort Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                In this algorithm , To sort an array of size N in ascending order iterate over the array and compare the
                current element (key) to its predecessor, if the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it
                to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

            <h3>Selection Sort Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                In this algorithm , we repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of
                the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the
                remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted.
