        <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
        <p class="para1">Sorting algorithms are used to sort a data structure according to a specific order
            relationship, such as
            numerical order or lexicographical order.There are currently hundreds of different sorting algorithms, each
            with its own specific characteristics. They
            are classified according to two metrics: space complexity and time complexity.</p>
        <p class="para2">This operation is one of the most important and widespread in computer science. For a long time,
            new methods
            have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster.Those two kinds of complexity are represented
            with asymptotic notations, mainly with the symbols O, Θ, Ω,
            representing respectively the upper bound, the tight bound, and the lower bound of the algorithm's
            complexity,
            specifying in brackets an expression in terms of n, the number of the elements of the data structure.</p>
